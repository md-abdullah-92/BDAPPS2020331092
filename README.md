__<span style="color: green;">App Description:</span>__

Our application is designed to publish the results of any educational institution. With this app, students can view their examination results by entering their roll number, class, date of birth, and the EIIN (Educational Institute Identification Number) of their educational institution.

On the other hand, to create results, the authorities of the educational institution must first register using their EIIN number. The institution's phone number will already be saved in our database, and an OTP will be sent to that number for verification. After verification, a password needs to be set. Once the password is set, the authorities must subscribe using that phone number. Upon successful subscription, the authorities will gain access to the database information. By logging into the database via MySQL Workbench, the authorities can submit subject-wise results, which students will then be able to view through the app.
